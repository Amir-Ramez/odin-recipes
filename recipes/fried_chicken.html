   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken,
      is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried,
      deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.
      The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>
